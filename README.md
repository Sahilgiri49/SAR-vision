# 🌈 **SAR Image Colorization with AI** 🌍

Welcome to the **SAR Image Colorization** project! 🎨 This project aims to bring life to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using AI-based techniques. We utilize deep learning models to colorize grayscale SAR images, making them more visually informative and easier to interpret. 🚀

### 🚀 **Key Features**:
- 🎨 Colorization of SAR images using AI models
- 🌍 Enhances visual clarity and interpretation
- 💻 Simple and easy-to-follow setup
- 🖼️ Generates vibrant and meaningful colored images

## 🛠️ **Installation & Setup**:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahilgiri49/SAR-vision.git
   cd SAR-vision
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. You can create a virtual environment for this project to keep dependencies isolated.

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv sar-env
source sar-env/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
sar-env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install necessary libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🖼️ How to Colorize SAR Images:
Prepare your SAR Image: 📸
Make sure you have a grayscale SAR image in .png or .jpg format.

Run the colorization script:
After setting up the environment, use the following command to run the colorization process:

bash
Copy
Edit
python colorize_sar.py --input_path path_to_your_image --output_path path_to_save_colored_image
View the Output:
Your colorized SAR image will be saved in the output path you specified. Open it to see the results! 🎨👀

⚡ Example:
Here’s an example of how you would run the colorization process for a sample image:


python colorize_sar.py --input_path ./images/sample_sar_image.jpg --output_path ./output/colorized_image.jpg
